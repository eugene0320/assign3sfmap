# Assignment 3: Creating Interactive Visualization Software

## Group Work Breakdown

This assignment was completed as a group of two.

- **Eugene Hong**  
  Implemented the core D3 visualization, including data loading and preprocessing, geographic projection, rendering film locations, dynamic query logic with two draggable query circles, and additional filters (release year range and director). Also handled debugging, performance optimization, and integration in Observable.

- **Jennifer Minh Quach**  
  Focused on interaction design and usability, including hover tooltips displaying film metadata, visual styling for filtered vs. non-filtered points, and testing edge cases to ensure correct behavior across filters and interactions. Also contributed to final polishing and the write-up.

## Development Process Commentary

We spent approximately **18–20 hours** developing the application. The most time-consuming aspects were implementing and debugging the dynamic query interaction (draggable circles and intersection logic) and ensuring the visualization updated at interactive rates while remaining visually clear.
